# Memory Tool Implementation - Complete Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (Ready for Testing)
**Branch**: development

---

## Executive Summary

The Grant Card Assistant now has **persistent memory capabilities** across conversations using Anthropic's Memory Tool. This enables:

✅ **Learning from Feedback** - User corrections are saved and referenced in future conversations
✅ **Cross-Conversation Workflows** - Multi-day projects can be paused and resumed seamlessly
✅ **Knowledge Base Building** - Successful patterns and approaches accumulate over time
✅ **Project Tracking** - Active projects are tracked with full context preservation

### What Changed

1. **Memory Tool Handler** (`api/memory-tool-handler.js`) - Complete file operation system with security
2. **API Integration** - Memory tool added to all Claude API requests (streaming & non-streaming)
3. **System Prompts** - All 5 agents now include memory tool instructions
4. **Beta Headers** - Added `context-management-2025-06-27` for memory tool support

### Impact

- **User corrections persist** - "Actually, coaching programs ARE eligible" is remembered forever
- **Multi-day projects work** - "Let's continue tomorrow" maintains full context
- **Patterns accumulate** - Each successful grant card makes the next one better
- **Zero redundancy** - Never ask users to repeat information across sessions

## Implementation Details

### File 1: Memory Tool Handler

**Location**: `api/memory-tool-handler.js`
**Purpose**: Execute all memory operations with security validation

**Key Functions**:

```javascript
handleMemoryTool(command, input)
  ├─ handleView(input)          // Read memory files
  ├─ handleCreate(input)        // Create new memories
  ├─ handleStrReplace(input)    // Update existing memories
  ├─ handleInsert(input)        // Insert at specific lines
  ├─ handleDelete(input)        // Delete memory files
  └─ handleRename(input)        // Rename/move memories
```

**Security Features**:
- Path traversal protection (all paths restricted to `/memories` directory)
- File size limits (1MB max per file)
- Path validation and sanitization
- Error handling for all operations

**Memory Directory Structure**:
```
/memories/
├── user_feedback/
│   ├── corrections.xml
│   ├── approvals.xml
│   └── preferences.xml
├── projects/
│   ├── active/           # In-progress multi-day projects

```

### File 2: API Server Integration

**Location**: `api/server.js`
**Changes**: 6 key updates

#### Change 1: Import Memory Handler (Line 10)
```javascript
const { handleMemoryTool } = require('./memory-tool-handler');
```

#### Change 2: Define Memory Tool (Lines 3753-3844)
```javascript
const MEMORY_TOOL = {
  type: "memory_20250818",
  name: "memory",
  commands: [
    { command: "view", description: "Read memory file", ... },
    { command: "create", description: "Create new memory", ... },
    { command: "str_replace", description: "Replace content", ... },
    // ... all 6 commands
  ]
};
```

#### Change 3: Process Memory Tool Use (Lines 3846-3891)
```javascript
async function processMemoryToolUse(contentBlocks) {
  // Detects memory tool_use blocks
  // Executes memory operations
  // Returns tool_result blocks
}
```

#### Change 4: Update Non-Streaming API (Lines 3922, 3929, 4026-4047)
```javascript
// Add memory tool to tools array
tools: [WEB_SEARCH_TOOL, MEMORY_TOOL]

// Add beta header
'anthropic-beta': 'files-api-2025-04-14,context-management-2025-06-27'

// Process memory tool uses and continue conversation
const memoryToolResults = await processMemoryToolUse(data.content || []);
if (memoryToolResults && memoryToolResults.length > 0) {
  // Add tool results and make follow-up API call
  return await callClaudeAPI(messages, systemPrompt, files);
}
```

#### Change 5: Update Streaming API (Lines 4083, 4092)
```javascript
// Add memory tool to streaming requests
tools: [webSearchTool, MEMORY_TOOL]

// Add beta header
'anthropic-beta': 'files-api-2025-04-14,context-management-2025-06-27'
```

#### Change 6: Add Memory Instructions to All Agents (Lines 2025-2142, 1230, 2157, 2362, 2342, 2845)
```javascript
const MEMORY_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS = `
<memory_tool>
  <memory_structure>...</memory_structure>
  <when_to_use_memory>...</when_to_use_memory>
  <memory_commands>...</memory_commands>
  <memory_best_practices>...</memory_best_practices>
  <example_memory_usage>...</example_memory_usage>
</memory_tool>
`;

// Integrated into:
// - Grant Cards agent (GRANT_CARD_SYSTEM_PROMPT, line 1230)
// - ETG Writer agent (line 2157)
// - CanExport Writer agent (line 2342)
// - CanExport Claims agent (line 2362)
// - BCAFE Writer agent (line 2845)
```

## Memory Tool Instructions

Each agent now has comprehensive memory guidance:

### When to Use Memory

**Save memories when:**
1. User corrects you → `/memories/user_feedback/corrections.xml`
2. User approves an approach → `/memories/user_feedback/approvals.xml`
3. Multi-day project → `/memories/projects/active/[project-name].xml`
4. Project completed → Move to `/memories/projects/completed/`
5. New eligibility rule learned → `/memories/knowledge_base/eligibility_rules/`
6. Successful grant card → `/memories/knowledge_base/grant_patterns/`
7. Edge case encountered → `/memories/knowledge_base/common_issues/`

**Check memory when:**
- Starting new conversation (check for corrections, preferences)
- User asks "where were we?" (check active projects)
- Similar project (check completed projects for patterns)
- Uncertain about eligibility (check knowledge base)

### Memory Commands

1. **view** - Read memory file contents
2. **create** - Create new memory file
3. **str_replace** - Update existing memory (find and replace)
4. **insert** - Insert content at specific line
5. **delete** - Delete memory file
6. **rename** - Rename or move memory file

### Best Practices

1. **XML Format** - Use structured XML for easy parsing and updates
2. **Descriptive Names** - Clear, specific file names (e.g., `canexport-sme-eligibility-rules.xml`)
3. **Timestamps** - Include dates for context
4. **Categories** - Organize by topic (corrections, patterns, projects)
5. **Atomic Updates** - Use `str_replace` for small changes, `create` for new files
6. **References** - Include source information (grant name, conversation ID)

---

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Learning from Corrections

**Scenario**: User corrects eligibility interpretation

```
User: "Actually, coaching programs ARE eligible if they're structured training,
       not just mentoring"

Agent Action:
1. Use memory tool (view) to read /memories/user_feedback/corrections.xml
2. If exists, use str_replace to add correction
3. If new, use create:

<corrections>
  <correction date="2025-10-15" topic="ETG Eligibility">
    <original>Coaching programs are ineligible</original>
    <corrected>Coaching programs ARE eligible if structured training
                (not just mentoring)</corrected>
    <source>Conversation: etg-writer-20251015</source>
  </correction>
</corrections>

Result: Next conversation automatically checks corrections file and
        applies learned rule
```

### Use Case 2: Multi-Day Project Tracking

**Scenario**: User pauses work on grant application

```
User: "I need to stop here, let's continue tomorrow"

Agent Action:
Use memory tool (create) to save project state:
Path: /memories/projects/active/acme-corp-canexport.xml

<project name="ACME Corp CanExport Application" date="2025-10-15">
  <status>In Progress</status>
  <completed>
    - Eligibility verified
    - Company information gathered
    - Grant Card created (approved by user)
  </completed>
  <next_steps>
    - Draft market analysis section
    - Create export readiness assessment
  </next_steps>
  <files>
    - company-profile.pdf (uploaded)
    - export-plan-draft.docx (uploaded)
  </files>
</project>

Next Day:
User: "Let's continue with the CanExport application"
Agent: (views active project file) "Picking up where we left off -
       I'll now draft the market analysis section based on the company
       profile you provided..."
```

### Use Case 3: Approved Format Storage

**Scenario**: User approves a specific grant card format

```
User: "This grant card format is perfect - use this structure for all
       future CanExport cards"

Agent Action:
Use memory tool (create):
Path: /memories/user_feedback/approvals.xml

<approvals>
  <approval date="2025-10-15" type="Grant Card Format" program="CanExport SME">
    <approved_elements>
      - Eligibility section: Bullet points with "✓" for eligible, "✗" for not
      - Funding: Show calculation formula (e.g., "50% of $75,000 = $37,500")
      - Timeline: Include both application deadline AND project timeline
      - Key Requirements: Maximum 5 bullets, priority order
    </approved_elements>
    <user_preference>Concise, scannable, action-oriented</user_preference>
    <source>Grant Card: canexport-sme-202510</source>
  </approval>
</approvals>

Result: Future CanExport grant cards automatically follow approved format
```

### Use Case 4: Building Institutional Knowledge

**Scenario**: Successful grant application pattern

```
Agent completes successful grant card

Agent Action:
Use memory tool (create):
Path: /memories/knowledge_base/grant_patterns/canexport-tech-export.xml

<pattern program="CanExport SME" industry="Technology" date="2025-10-15">
  <success_factors>
    - Emphasized digital service export (SaaS platform)
    - Clear market validation (pilot customers in target market)
    - Specific market entry strategy (partnership with local distributor)
    - Realistic budget ($45,000 total, $22,500 funding requested)
  </success_factors>
  <effective_positioning>
    - Positioned as "market expansion" not "market research"
    - Highlighted export-readiness (existing product, proven PMF)
    - Demonstrated market knowledge (competitor analysis included)
  </effective_positioning>
  <application_outcome>Approved (36% benchmark exceeded)</application_outcome>
</pattern>

Result: Future tech export applications reference successful pattern
```

## Technical Architecture

### Memory Tool Flow

```
User Request
     ↓
Claude API Call (with tools: [webSearchTool, memoryTool])
     ↓
Claude Response with Content Blocks:
  - thinking blocks (planning)
  - tool_use blocks (memory operations)
  - text blocks (user-facing response)
     ↓
[If memory tool_use detected]
     ↓
processMemoryToolUse():
  1. Extract tool_use blocks where name === "memory"
  2. Execute memory operation via handleMemoryTool()
  3. Create tool_result blocks with operation results
     ↓
Continue Conversation:
  1. Add assistant message (with tool_use) to conversation
  2. Add user message (with tool_results) to conversation
  3. Make new API call to get final response
     ↓
Display to User:
  - extractTextFromResponse() extracts only text blocks
  - Clean response shown (no tool internals visible)
     ↓
Conversation Storage (Redis/PostgreSQL):
  - Full content block array stored (including memory tool use)
  - Future sessions can reference memory operations
```

### Security Model

**Path Validation**:
```javascript
function validatePath(requestedPath) {
  // Must start with /memories
  if (!requestedPath.startsWith('/memories')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid path: must start with /memories');
  }

  // Resolve and verify within base directory
  const absolutePath = path.join(MEMORY_BASE_DIR,
                                  requestedPath.replace('/memories', ''));
  const resolvedPath = path.resolve(absolutePath);

  // Prevent path traversal
  if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(MEMORY_BASE_DIR)) {
    throw new Error('Path traversal detected');
  }

  return resolvedPath;
}
```

**File Size Limits**:
- Maximum 1MB per memory file
- Prevents abuse and storage bloat

**Error Handling**:
- All operations wrapped in try-catch
- Errors returned as tool_result with `is_error: true`
- Never crashes agent on memory operation failure

---

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Unit Testing (Recommended Next Step)

Create `tests/memory-tool-test.js`:

```javascript
// Test 1: Basic Memory Operations
- Create memory file
- View memory file
- Update memory file (str_replace)
- Delete memory file

// Test 2: Path Security
- Attempt path traversal (should fail)
- Invalid paths (should fail)
- Valid paths (should succeed)

// Test 3: Agent Integration
- Agent uses memory tool
- Tool results processed correctly
- Conversation continues correctly

// Test 4: Cross-Session Learning
- Save correction in session 1
- New session 2 references correction
- Verify learning persisted
```

### Phase 2: Integration Testing

**Test Scenario**: Learning from Corrections

1. Start ETG Writer conversation
2. Ask about coaching program eligibility
3. Agent says "ineligible"
4. User corrects: "Actually, coaching IS eligible if structured"
5. **Verify**: Agent uses memory tool to save correction
6. **Verify**: Correction saved to `/memories/user_feedback/corrections.xml`
7. Start NEW ETG Writer conversation
8. Ask same question about coaching programs
9. **Verify**: Agent checks memory, applies correction, says "eligible"

**Test Scenario**: Multi-Day Project

1. Start CanExport Writer conversation
2. Provide company info, draft first section
3. User says: "Let's pause here, continue tomorrow"
4. **Verify**: Agent saves project state to `/memories/projects/active/`
5. Start NEW CanExport Writer conversation
6. User says: "Let's continue the CanExport application"
7. **Verify**: Agent loads project state, resumes exactly where left off

### Phase 3: Real-World Usage

- Use agents normally with memory enabled
- Monitor memory file creation and usage
- Collect feedback on learning effectiveness
- Refine memory organization based on usage patterns

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying

- [ ] Run unit tests (`npm run test:memory`)
- [ ] Test basic memory operations manually
- [ ] Verify path security (attempt traversal attacks)
- [ ] Test with each agent (at least smoke test)
- [ ] Check memory directory creation
- [ ] Verify file size limits enforced
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid paths, missing files)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Merge to main**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge development
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Monitor initial usage**:
   - Check server logs for memory tool usage
   - Verify memory files being created
   - Watch for errors in memory operations
   - Monitor performance (no slowdowns)

4. **Rollback plan**:
   - If issues: `git revert HEAD`
   - Redeploy previous version
   - Memory files persist (won't be deleted on rollback)

---

## Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: First-Time User Correction

**User**: "Actually, seminars CAN be eligible for ETG if they're multi-day skill-building"

**Agent**:
1. Acknowledges correction
2. Uses memory tool (view) to check `/memories/user_feedback/corrections.xml`
3. File doesn't exist, so uses memory tool (create) to create it
4. Saves correction with timestamp and context
5. Continues conversation with corrected understanding

**Memory File Created**:
```xml
<corrections>
  <correction date="2025-10-15" topic="ETG Eligibility - Seminars">
    <original>Seminars are always ineligible for ETG</original>
    <corrected>Seminars CAN be eligible if multi-day skill-building format</corrected>
    <source>etg-writer-20251015-143022</source>
  </correction>
</corrections>
```

**Next Session**:
User: "Is this 3-day leadership seminar eligible for ETG?"
Agent: (checks corrections.xml, finds seminar rule) "Yes! Multi-day skill-building seminars are eligible for ETG. This 3-day leadership seminar would qualify..."

### Scenario 2: Multi-Day Grant Application

**Day 1**:
- User provides company info
- Agent drafts eligibility analysis
- User says "Let's continue tomorrow"
- Agent saves to `/memories/projects/active/company-x-canexport.xml`

**Day 2**:
- User: "Let's continue with the CanExport application"
- Agent views project file, sees status
- Agent: "Continuing with your CanExport application. I've already verified eligibility and gathered company information. I'll now draft the market analysis section..."

**Day 5** (after completion):
- Agent renames: `/memories/projects/active/company-x-canexport.xml` → `/memories/projects/completed/company-x-canexport.xml`
- Future similar applications reference this as successful pattern

---

## Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:

### Memory Usage Metrics
- **Memory Files Created**: How many memories saved per agent
- **Memory Files Referenced**: How often memories checked/used
- **Cross-Session Learning**: Corrections applied in new conversations
- **Project Resumptions**: Multi-day projects successfully continued

### Quality Metrics
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Fewer questions asked twice
- **Improved Accuracy**: Corrections applied consistently
- **Faster Workflows**: Project resumptions save time
- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Successful patterns reused

### Performance Metrics
- **API Response Time**: No significant slowdown from memory operations
- **Error Rate**: Memory tool errors < 1%
- **Storage Usage**: Memory files within expected size limits

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features (Future Consideration)

1. **Memory Search**
   - Add search functionality across all memories
   - "Find all corrections related to CanExport eligibility"

2. **Memory Analytics**
   - Dashboard showing memory usage patterns
   - Most-referenced memories
   - Knowledge gaps identified

3. **Memory Sharing**
   - Share approved patterns across users/teams
   - Export/import memory files

4. **Memory Expiration**
   - Auto-archive old memories
   - Purge outdated corrections

5. **Memory Conflicts**
   - Detect conflicting corrections
   - Request user clarification

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Memory files not being created

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify memory directory exists
ls -la memories/

# Check server logs for memory tool usage
# Should see: "🧠 Memory tool: create at /memories/..."
```

**Solution**: Ensure memory directories initialized on server start

### Issue: Path traversal errors

**Check**:
```bash
# Review memory tool logs
# Look for: "Path traversal detected"
```

**Solution**: This is expected security behavior - agent should retry with valid path

### Issue: Memory not persisting across sessions

**Check**:
- Verify memory files created on filesystem
- Check file permissions
- Verify agent checking memory at conversation start

**Solution**: Review agent system prompt - ensure memory check instructions included
