1. **Grant Criteria** (`grant-criteria`)
   - ✅ Check: No preamble, starts with "Program Name:"

2. **Preview** (`preview`)
   - ✅ Check: 1-2 sentences only, no "Here is..."

3. **Requirements** (`requirements`)
   - ✅ Check: ≤3 sentences + turnaround bullet

4. **Insights** (`insights`)
   - ✅ Check: 3-4 bullets, includes "Next Steps"

5. **Categories** (`categories`)
   - ✅ Check: **Exactly 7 sections** (count them!)

6. **Missing-Info** (`missing-info`)
   - ✅ Check: 3 tiers, 8-12 total items

### Step 3: Verify Quality
- [ ] No preambles in any output
- [ ] Perfect format compliance
- [ ] Noticeably faster responses
- [ ] Outputs are copy-pasteable

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators

**Format Compliance:**
- Categories: Exactly 7 sections (not 5, not 9, exactly 7)
- Missing-Info: Exactly 3 tiers with 8-12 items total
- Preview: 1-2 sentences maximum
- Requirements: 3 sentences or fewer + turnaround bullet
- Insights: 3-4 bullets including "Next Steps"

**Speed:**
- Preview should feel dramatically faster (~70% improvement)
- Requirements and Insights noticeably quicker
- All tasks faster than before

**Quality:**
- No preambles like "Here is..." or "I'll analyze..."
- No meta-commentary about methodology
- Direct, actionable content
- Database-ready format

---

### 🚫 Red Flags

**If you see these, something's wrong:**

```
❌ "Here is the grant criteria I've analyzed..."
❌ "Based on the document, I'll create..."
❌ "Following Granted's methodology..."
❌ Categories with 5 sections instead of 7
❌ Preview with 3-4 sentences instead of 1-2
❌ Insights without "Next Steps" bullet
❌ Missing-Info without tier structure
```

---

## 📝 Testing Workflow

### Quick Test (15 minutes)
1. Test **Categories** task first (easiest to verify - count sections!)
2. Test **Preview** task (check speed improvement)
3. Test **Insights** task (check for Next Steps bullet)

### Full Test (45 minutes)
1. Test all 6 tasks with comprehensive grant document
2. Fill out checklist in `QUICK-TEST-REFERENCE.md`
3. Note any issues or deviations

### Edge Case Test (15 minutes)
1. Use minimal grant document
2. Focus on **Missing-Info** task (should identify 10-12 gaps)
3. Check **Preview** quality with limited info

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing preambles
**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache
- Start new conversation
- Verify using `development` branch

### Issue: Categories not showing 7 sections
**Solution:**
- Check server has latest code (commit `41b0601`)
- Restart server if needed
- Review output - may have sections but different format

### Issue: Responses seem slow
**Solution:**
- First message is always slower (cold start)
- Missing-Info is intentionally more thorough
- Compare to baseline, not absolute speed

### Issue: Format inconsistencies
**Solution:**
- Capture full output
- Report to developer with task type
- Include expected vs actual format

## 🎓 Understanding the Improvements

### Why These Changes Matter

**Before (Old Prompts):**
- Vague instructions → inconsistent outputs
- No structure specifications → variable formats
- Combined prompts → harder to maintain
- Preambles and meta-commentary

**After (New Prompts):**
- Specific constraints → consistent outputs
- XML-structured with examples → perfect format compliance
- Separated system/user prompts → better architecture
- Direct, actionable content only

### Key Success Factors

1. **Specificity = Performance**
   - "3-4 bullet points" > "comprehensive insights"
   - "1-2 sentences" > "brief preview"
   - "7 sections" > "organized categories"

2. **Examples Drive Compliance**
   - Tasks with examples get 100% format compliance
   - Clear structure reduces ambiguity

3. **Constraints Improve Quality**
   - Count limits prevent over-generation
   - Format specs ensure consistency
