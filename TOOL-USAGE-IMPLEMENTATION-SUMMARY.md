### Architecture

```
User Request
     ↓
Claude API Call (with tools: [webSearchTool])
     ↓
Response with Content Blocks:
  - thinking blocks (hidden from user)
  - tool_use blocks (preserved in history)
  - web_search_tool_result blocks (preserved in history)
  - text blocks (shown to user)
     ↓
Conversation Storage (Redis):
  - Full content block array stored
     ↓
Display to User:
  - extractTextFromResponse() extracts only text
  - Clean response shown
```

## Sample Conversation Structure

### Turn 1: Initial Query with Web Search

**User**: "What are the latest ETG grant requirements?"

**Assistant Response** (stored in conversation):
```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "thinking",
      "thinking": "I need to search for current ETG information..."
    },
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01ABC123",
      "name": "web_search",
      "input": {
        "query": "BC Employee Training Grant requirements 2025"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "web_search_tool_result",
      "content": [
        {
          "url": "https://example.com/etg",
          "title": "ETG Program Requirements",
          "snippet": "Latest requirements..."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Based on the latest information, the ETG program requires..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**User sees**: "Based on the latest information, the ETG program requires..."

### Turn 2: Follow-up Question (Uses Previous Context)

**User**: "What are the application deadlines?"

**Assistant Response** (stored in conversation):
```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "thinking",
      "thinking": "I can reference the previous search results..."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "According to the information I found, the deadlines are..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**User sees**: "According to the information I found, the deadlines are..."

**Key observation**: No new web search needed - Claude referenced previous tool results!

### 📋 Manual Testing Required

To complete validation, perform these manual tests:

#### **Test 1: Single Turn with Web Search**

1. Start server: `npm run dev`
2. Open Grant Cards agent: http://localhost:3000/grant-cards
3. Query: "What are the latest CanExport SME requirements?"
4. **Check logs** for:
   ```
   🌐 WEB SEARCH INITIATED: web_search
   🔧 Tool use block captured: web_search
   📄 WEB SEARCH RESULT: Found N results
   ```
5. **Check Redis** conversation state:
   ```bash
   # Get conversation ID from response
   redis-cli GET "conversation:<conversationId>"
   ```
6. **Verify**:
   - Content is array (not string)
   - Contains tool_use block with id
   - Contains web_search_tool_result block
   - Contains text block

**Expected**: ✅ All blocks present in conversation history

---

#### **Test 2: Multi-Turn with Context**

1. **Turn 1**: "Search for BC Employee Training Grant requirements"
   - Should trigger web search
   - Check logs for `🌐 WEB SEARCH INITIATED`

2. **Turn 2**: "What are the application deadlines?"
   - Should NOT trigger new search (uses previous context)
   - Check logs - should NOT see new web search

3. **Turn 3**: "How does this compare to CanExport?"
   - Should trigger NEW search (different topic)
   - Check logs for `🌐 WEB SEARCH INITIATED`

**Expected**:
- ✅ Turn 1: Web search used
- ✅ Turn 2: Previous results referenced
- ✅ Turn 3: New search for comparison

---

#### **Test 3: Display Verification**

1. Make request that uses web search
2. Inspect frontend display
3. Check browser console for response

**Expected**:
- ✅ Only text visible to user
- ✅ No JSON structures visible
- ✅ No tool_use blocks in display
- ✅ Clean, readable response

---

#### **Test 4: Streaming vs Non-Streaming**

**Non-Streaming (Grant Cards)**:
1. Query Grant Cards agent
2. Check server logs
3. Verify tool blocks captured

**Streaming (ETG Writer)**:
1. Query ETG Writer agent
2. Check server logs for:
   ```
   🌐 STREAMING TOOL USED: web_search
   🔧 Tool use block captured: web_search
   ```
3. Verify tool blocks in conversation

**Expected**: ✅ Both code paths preserve tool history

---

#### **Test 5: Redis Inspection**

```bash
# Get conversation
redis-cli GET "conversation:grant-cards-<timestamp>"

# Pretty print assistant responses
redis-cli GET "conversation:grant-cards-<timestamp>" | jq '.[] | select(.role == "assistant") | .content'

# Check for content block types
redis-cli GET "conversation:grant-cards-<timestamp>" | jq '.[] | select(.role == "assistant") | .content[] | .type'
```

**Expected types**:
- `thinking` (optional)
- `tool_use` (when web search used)
- `web_search_tool_result` (when web search used)
- `text` (always)

---

## Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: Grant Research Query

**User**: "What are the eligibility criteria for CanExport SME?"

**System**:
1. Searches web for current CanExport information
2. Stores tool_use block with search query
3. Stores tool_result block with search results
4. Generates answer from search results
5. Shows clean text to user
6. Preserves all blocks in Redis

**User sees**: Clean answer about eligibility criteria

**Conversation history contains**: Full blocks for future context

### Scenario 2: Follow-up Question

**User**: "What about the funding amounts?"

**System**:
1. Sees previous search results in conversation history
2. References previous tool_result block
3. Answers from existing context
4. No new search needed
5. Shows clean text to user

**User sees**: Answer about funding amounts

**Logs show**: No new web search (used previous context)

### Scenario 3: New Topic

**User**: "How does this compare to the ETG program?"

**System**:
1. Recognizes need for new information
2. Performs new web search for ETG
3. Stores new tool blocks
4. Compares both programs
5. Shows clean text to user

**User sees**: Comparison of CanExport vs ETG

**Conversation history contains**: Both sets of tool results

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tool blocks not appearing in conversation

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify extractTextFromResponse is defined
grep -n "function extractTextFromResponse" api/server.js

# Verify callClaudeAPI returns content blocks
grep -n "return data.content" api/server.js
```

**Solution**: Ensure latest code deployed

### Issue: User sees JSON or tool blocks

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify extractTextFromResponse is called before res.json
grep -n "extractTextFromResponse(response)" api/server.js
```

**Solution**: Ensure display extraction is working

### Issue: Multi-turn context not working

**Check Redis**:
```bash
redis-cli GET "conversation:<id>" | jq '.[] | select(.role == "assistant") | .content'
```

**Expected**: Should see array of content blocks, not strings

**Solution**: Verify conversation storage is using new format

---

## Success Metrics
