# CanExport Claims Agent - Document Tracking Fix

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Issue**: Agent re-analyzing all documents instead of only new ones
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
**Commit**: `257f15c`

---

## Problem Description

When users uploaded multiple documents in sequence to the CanExport Claims agent, the agent would re-analyze ALL documents (including previously reviewed ones) with every new upload, resulting in:

- ‚ùå Repetitive analysis of the same documents
- ‚ùå Verbose responses (3000+ words re-analyzing everything)
- ‚ùå Confusion about which documents need action
- ‚ùå Wasted time reading duplicate analysis
- ‚ùå Inefficient token usage

### User Feedback

> "The only thing I wanted to let you know happens is that when I have it check one doc and then add another doc for it to check it will keep giving me its thoughts on all the documents not just the new one I've added in."

---

## Solution Implemented

Added comprehensive **document tracking system** to the CanExport Claims agent prompt with:

### 1. Document Tracking Instructions (63 lines)

New `<document_tracking>` section that forces the agent to:

```
**STEP 1: CHECK WHAT'S BEEN REVIEWED**
- Which invoices/receipts have I already analyzed?
- Which funding agreements have I already reviewed?
- What verdicts have I already provided?

**STEP 2: IDENTIFY ONLY NEW DOCUMENTS**
- Look at current message for NEW documents
- Compare to previously analyzed documents
- Only analyze documents you haven't reviewed yet

**STEP 3: REFERENCE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS (DON'T REPEAT)**
- DO NOT re-analyze previously reviewed documents
- INSTEAD: "‚úì [Document name] - Already reviewed (see previous message)"

**STEP 4: ANALYZE ONLY NEW DOCUMENTS**
- Clearly state: "üìÑ NEW DOCUMENT: [filename]"
- Perform full analysis following the workflow
- Provide complete verdict
```

### 2. Proper XML Structure in `<thinking>`

Updated the thinking template to include document tracking as the first step:

```xml
<thinking>
<document_tracking>
  <previously_reviewed>
    <!-- List filenames already analyzed in this conversation -->
  </previously_reviewed>
  <new_documents>
    <!-- List filenames that need analysis in this message -->
  </new_documents>
  <focus>
    <!-- State which documents you will analyze (only NEW ones) -->
  </focus>
</document_tracking>

<mode>Quick Check / Full Audit</mode>

<expense_extraction>
  <!-- FOR NEW DOCUMENTS ONLY -->
  <vendor>[name]</vendor>
  <amount_before_taxes>[amount]</amount_before_taxes>
  ...
</expense_extraction>
...
</thinking>
```

### 3. Clear Example Pattern

Provided concrete example of correct behavior:

```
User uploads 3 invoices initially ‚Üí Agent analyzes all 3

User uploads 2 MORE invoices ‚Üí Agent responds:

"I see 5 documents total:

‚úì Invoice-1.pdf - Already reviewed (‚úÖ APPROVED - $500 reimbursable)
‚úì Invoice-2.pdf - Already reviewed (‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ADJUSTMENT - remove taxes)
‚úì Invoice-3.pdf - Already reviewed (‚ùå REJECTED - Amazon purchase)

üìÑ NEW DOCUMENT: Invoice-4.pdf
[Full analysis of Invoice-4]

üìÑ NEW DOCUMENT: Invoice-5.pdf
[Full analysis of Invoice-5]"
```

### 4. Red Flags to Avoid

Explicitly listed anti-patterns:

- ‚ùå Every response starts with "I see X documents total" and analyzes all of them
- ‚ùå Providing verdicts for invoices already reviewed
- ‚ùå User uploads 1 new invoice and agent analyzes 10 old ones too
- ‚ùå Response is 3000 words re-analyzing everything from scratch

### 5. Correct Pattern

Clear guidance on desired behavior:

- ‚úÖ Check conversation history first
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge previously reviewed documents with quick reference
- ‚úÖ Focus 90% of response on NEW documents only
- ‚úÖ User gets clear signal: "Here's what's NEW and needs your attention"

## Implementation Details

### File Modified

**`api/server.js`**
- Lines 2442-2505: New `<document_tracking>` section
- Lines 2562-2625: Updated `<thinking>` template with proper XML structure
- Total changes: 127 insertions(+), 45 deletions(-)

### Key Changes

1. **Added document tracking section** before analysis workflow
2. **Restructured thinking template** as proper XML with document tracking first
3. **Provided concrete examples** of correct vs incorrect behavior
4. **Listed red flags** to explicitly avoid
5. **Emphasized focus** on NEW documents only

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: First Upload (3 invoices)

**User uploads**: Invoice-1.pdf, Invoice-2.pdf, Invoice-3.pdf

**Agent response**:
```
<thinking>
<document_tracking>
  <previously_reviewed>None - this is the first upload</previously_reviewed>
  <new_documents>Invoice-1.pdf, Invoice-2.pdf, Invoice-3.pdf</new_documents>
  <focus>All three documents are new - will analyze all</focus>
</document_tracking>
...
</thinking>

[Full analysis of all 3 invoices]
```

### Scenario 2: Second Upload (2 more invoices)

**User uploads**: Invoice-4.pdf, Invoice-5.pdf

**Agent response**:
```
<thinking>
<document_tracking>
  <previously_reviewed>
    Invoice-1.pdf (APPROVED - $500 reimbursable)
    Invoice-2.pdf (NEEDS ADJUSTMENT - remove $65 in taxes)
    Invoice-3.pdf (REJECTED - Amazon retail purchase)
  </previously_reviewed>
  <new_documents>Invoice-4.pdf, Invoice-5.pdf</new_documents>
  <focus>Only Invoice-4 and Invoice-5 need analysis</focus>
</document_tracking>
...
</thinking>

I see 5 documents total:

‚úì Invoice-1.pdf - Already reviewed (‚úÖ APPROVED - $500 reimbursable)
‚úì Invoice-2.pdf - Already reviewed (‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ADJUSTMENT - remove taxes)
‚úì Invoice-3.pdf - Already reviewed (‚ùå REJECTED - retail purchase)

üìÑ NEW DOCUMENT: Invoice-4.pdf
[Full analysis of Invoice-4 only]

üìÑ NEW DOCUMENT: Invoice-5.pdf
[Full analysis of Invoice-5 only]
```

### Scenario 3: Follow-Up Question (No new documents)

**User asks**: "Can you explain why Invoice-3 was rejected?"

**Agent response**:
```
<thinking>
<document_tracking>
  <previously_reviewed>All 5 invoices already analyzed</previously_reviewed>
  <new_documents>None - user asking about previous analysis</new_documents>
  <focus>Provide detailed explanation of Invoice-3 rejection</focus>
</document_tracking>
...
</thinking>

Invoice-3.pdf was rejected because:

[Explanation referencing previous analysis]
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Test 1: Sequential Uploads

1. Upload 2 invoices ‚Üí Verify both analyzed
2. Upload 1 more invoice ‚Üí Verify only new invoice analyzed, previous 2 referenced
3. Upload 2 more invoices ‚Üí Verify only 2 new analyzed, previous 3 referenced

**Expected**: Each response focuses 90% on NEW documents, with brief reference to old ones

### Manual Test 2: Follow-Up Questions

1. Upload 3 invoices ‚Üí All analyzed
2. Ask "What was the verdict on Invoice-2?"
3. **Expected**: Quick summary of Invoice-2 without full re-analysis

### Manual Test 3: Mixed Uploads

1. Upload funding agreement + 1 invoice ‚Üí Both analyzed
2. Upload 2 more invoices ‚Üí Only new invoices analyzed, funding agreement not re-processed

**Expected**: Funding agreement context used but not re-analyzed

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge development
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Monitor Usage**
   - Watch for user feedback on multi-document uploads
   - Verify responses only analyze new documents
   - Check that previous documents are properly referenced

3. **Gather Feedback**
   - Does fix resolve the reported issue?
   - Are there other scenarios where re-analysis still occurs?
   - Is the "already reviewed" format clear to users?

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ User uploads additional documents ‚Üí Agent only analyzes new ones
‚úÖ Previously reviewed documents shown with verdict summary
‚úÖ Response length proportional to number of NEW documents
‚úÖ No redundant re-analysis of same documents
‚úÖ Clear distinction between old and new documents

---

**Fix Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED TO DEVELOPMENT**

The CanExport Claims agent now properly tracks which documents have been analyzed and only processes new documents in each message, eliminating redundant analysis and improving user experience.
