## 2. Test Strategy Design

### 2.1 Testing Principles (From Anthropic Guidelines)

1. **Golden Path Testing First** - Focus on correct usage with well-formed inputs before edge cases
2. **Realistic Test Data** - Use actual grant documents, real expense claims, authentic training scenarios
3. **Clear Success Criteria** - Define measurable pass/fail conditions for each test
4. **Appropriate Evaluation Methods**:
   - **Code-based**: Field completeness, structure validation, keyword detection
   - **LLM-based**: Quality assessment, tone/style evaluation, strategic insight value
5. **Fast Feedback Loops** - Prioritize quick-running unit tests over slow integration tests
6. **Consistency Checks** - Verify same inputs produce consistent outputs across runs

---

### 2.2 Test Categories

#### Category A: Structural Validation Tests (Code-based)
**What to Test**: Output structure, required fields, format compliance

**Examples**:
- Grant Cards: Verify XML structure contains all required sections (Preview, Requirements, Insights, Categories)
- CanExport Claims: Validate presence of `<expense_summary>`, `<compliance_analysis>`, `<verdict>`, `<recommendations>` tags
- ETG Writer: Confirm business case includes all mandatory sections
- BCAFE Writer: Check budget template structure and required fields

**Evaluation Method**: Regex parsing, JSON schema validation, field presence checks

**Pass Criteria**: 100% of required fields present with correct data types

---

#### Category B: Accuracy & Compliance Tests (Code-based + LLM hybrid)

**What to Test**: Factual correctness, rule compliance, calculation accuracy

**Examples**:
- Grant Cards: Correct grant type classification (verify against known examples)
- ETG Writer: Eligibility checker correctly identifies ineligible keywords
- BCAFE Writer: Cash match percentages calculated correctly (50% vs 30%)
- CanExport Claims: Tax calculations accurate, category assignments correct

**Evaluation Method**:
- Code-based: Mathematical calculations, keyword detection, classification logic
- LLM-based: Compliance with complex program rules requiring interpretation

**Pass Criteria**: 95%+ accuracy on known test cases

---

#### Category C: Quality & Strategic Value Tests (LLM-based)

**What to Test**: Tone, persuasiveness, strategic insight quality, professional writing standards

**Examples**:
- Grant Cards: Granted Insights provide competitive intelligence and actionable advice
- ETG Writer: Business case justification is compelling and addresses program priorities
- BCAFE Writer: Responses are merit-optimized for evaluation criteria
- CanExport Claims: Recommendations are actionable and prevent future rejections

**Evaluation Method**: LLM-as-judge with Claude Sonnet 4.5 using grading rubrics

**Grading Rubric Template**:
```
Scale: 1-5
1 = Fails to meet professional standards
2 = Below acceptable quality
3 = Meets minimum requirements
4 = Good quality, professional
5 = Excellent, publication-ready

Criteria:
- Clarity and coherence
- Strategic value and actionability
- Tone appropriateness for audience
- Adherence to Granted style guidelines
```

**Pass Criteria**: Average score ≥4.0 across all quality dimensions

---

#### Category D: Consistency Tests (Code-based)

**What to Test**: Same inputs produce similar outputs across multiple runs

**Examples**:
- Run identical grant document through Grant Cards 3 times, verify:
  - Grant type classification is identical
  - Funding amounts extracted are identical
  - Category tags are ≥90% consistent
- CanExport Claims: Same expense reviewed 3 times produces same verdict

**Evaluation Method**: Run tests multiple times, calculate variance

**Pass Criteria**: Core factual elements (amounts, dates, classifications) must be 100% consistent

---

#### Category E: Edge Case & Error Handling Tests (Code-based)

**What to Test**: Graceful handling of incomplete data, malformed inputs, missing information

**Examples**:
- Grant Cards: Missing deadline information triggers appropriate "missing-info" identification
- ETG Writer: Partially described training still gets eligibility assessment
- CanExport Claims: Expense missing tax information prompts for required details
- All agents: Handle empty messages, file upload errors, extremely long inputs

**Evaluation Method**: Error message validation, fallback behavior checks

**Pass Criteria**: No crashes, helpful error messages provided, clear guidance for resolution

---

### 2.3 Test Fixtures & Data Sets

#### Fixture Requirements by Agent:

**Grant Cards**:
- 6 sample grant documents (one per grant type: Hiring, Training, R&D, Market Expansion, Loan, Investment)
- 2 incomplete documents (missing key information for gap analysis testing)
- 1 ambiguous document (could fit multiple categories)

**ETG Writer**:
- 3 eligible training programs (certification, skills course, professional development)
- 3 ineligible programs (conference, seminar, degree program)
- 2 edge cases (borderline eligibility requiring judgment)

**BCAFE Writer**:
- 2 producer/processor scenarios (50% cash match)
- 1 association scenario (30% cash match)
- 1 multi-activity project (testing merit optimization across criteria)

**CanExport Writer**:
- 3 export scenarios (market expansion, trade shows, market research)
- 1 borderline eligibility case

**CanExport Claims**:
- 10 historical expenses (mix of approved, rejected, conditional)
  - 2 Category A (international airfare)
  - 2 Category B (marketing materials)
  - 2 Category C (translation services)
  - 2 Category D (shipping/courier)
  - 2 rejection pattern examples (Amazon office supplies, re-usable items)
- 3 edge cases (missing receipts, tax calculation errors, unclear categories)

## 6. Recommended Test Execution Schedule

### Daily During Development:
- Run unit tests on modified agents
- Quick smoke tests (1 test per agent, <2 min total)

### Pre-Deployment:
- Full test suite execution
- Review failed tests and flakiness report
- Require 95%+ pass rate before production deploy

### Weekly:
- Full integration test suite
- LLM quality evaluation (slower, more expensive)
- Generate trend report comparing to previous week

### Monthly:
- Review and update fixtures with new real-world examples
- Add new edge cases discovered in production
- Update grading rubrics based on quality standards evolution

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: LLM-based tests are slow and expensive
**Impact**: Long test cycles, high API costs

**Mitigation**:
- Use LLM grading only for quality tests (not structural/accuracy)
- Cache LLM evaluations for identical inputs
- Use smaller/faster model (Claude Haiku) for preliminary grading
- Run LLM tests less frequently (weekly vs. every commit)

---

### Risk 2: Claude API changes break tests
**Impact**: Tests fail due to API updates, not code issues

**Mitigation**:
- Version pin Claude API model (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
- Monitor Anthropic changelog for breaking changes
- Build adapter layer for API calls (easy to update one place)
- Include API response format validation in tests

---

### Risk 3: Test data becomes stale
**Impact**: Tests pass but don't reflect real-world usage

**Mitigation**:
- Quarterly review of fixtures against production data
- Add anonymized production cases as fixtures when bugs found
- Track new grant types/programs and add to test coverage

---

### Risk 4: Flaky tests due to non-deterministic AI outputs
**Impact**: Same test passes sometimes, fails other times

**Mitigation**:
- Use temperature=0 for deterministic outputs where possible
- Test core factual elements (amounts, dates, classifications) not exact wording
- Run consistency tests to measure and track variance
- Flag tests with >2% failure rate as "needs fixing"

---

## 8. Next Steps & Approval

### Questions for Review:

1. **Priority Agents**: Do you agree with the testing priority order (CanExport Claims → Grant Cards → ETG → BCAFE → CanExport Writer)?

2. **Test Coverage**: Are there specific capabilities or edge cases you want prioritized beyond what's outlined?

3. **Quality Thresholds**: Are the proposed pass criteria appropriate (95% accuracy, 4.0+ quality score)?

4. **Timeline**: Is the 8-day implementation timeline acceptable, or should we adjust scope?

5. **Fixtures**: Do you have existing grant documents, expense examples, or scenarios we should use as fixtures?

6. **CI Integration**: Do you want GitHub Actions setup for automated testing, or manual execution is sufficient?

7. **Reporting**: What format is most useful for test reports (HTML dashboard, JSON output, Slack notifications)?

### Upon Approval, I will:
1. Create the `/tests` directory structure
2. Build core testing utilities
3. Implement test suites starting with CanExport Claims (highest priority)
4. Generate initial baseline test report
