---

## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete Testing

### Step 1: Set API Key

Add your Anthropic API key to the environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

Or add to `.env` file (recommended):

```bash
# .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

Then install dotenv and update test script:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

### Step 2: Run Direct API Test

```bash
node test-grant-card-direct.js
```

**Expected Results:**
```

### Step 4: Test with Real Grant RFP

Once basic testing passes, create a follow-up test with actual grant RFP:

```javascript
const message = await client.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  max_tokens: 8192,
  system: combinedSystemPrompt,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `Create a Grant Card for this program:

[Paste actual grant RFP text here]

Please output in the XML format specified in your system prompt.`
    }
  ]
});
```

Expected: Complete XML grant card matching schema.

## 🚀 Future Integration Steps

After successful testing:

### 1. Backend Integration (api/server.js)
```javascript
// Add Agent SDK option alongside Google Drive
const useAgentSDK = process.env.USE_AGENT_SDK === 'true';

if (useAgentSDK) {
  // Load from .claude/ files
  const systemPrompt = await loadClaudeFiles();
} else {
  // Keep existing Google Drive loading
  await loadKnowledgeBaseFromGoogleDrive();
}
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment
- Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to Vercel environment variables
- Ensure .claude/ directory is included in deployment
- Test in preview environment before production

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Compare response times: Agent SDK vs Google Drive
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Track prompt caching effectiveness (50-75% savings expected)

---

## 📝 Notes

### Agent SDK `query()` Function Issue
The Agent SDK's `query()` function returned a transport object instead of the actual response. This appears to be either:
1. API has changed since documentation was written
2. Incorrect usage on our part
3. Bug in SDK version 0.1.10

**Resolution**: Use direct Anthropic API client for now, which is more stable and documented.

### Cost Estimation
- **System Prompt Size**: ~20,000 tokens (CLAUDE.md + grant-card.md)
- **With Prompt Caching**: First request ~$0.06 input, subsequent ~$0.015 input (75% savings)
- **Output**: ~$0.06 per 4K tokens
- **Total per Grant Card**: ~$0.12-$0.18 (with caching)

### Two Caching Systems Working Together

**Important**: This project uses TWO separate caching systems:

1. **Anthropic Prompt Caching** (Automatic)
   - Caches large system prompts (our 2,003 line grant-card.md)
   - First request: Full token count + 25% premium ($3.75/MTok vs $3/MTok)
   - Cache hits (within 5 min): 90% discount ($0.30/MTok vs $3/MTok)
   - **Result**: 75% token reduction on cached prompts
   - **No configuration needed** - happens automatically with Claude API
   - **Monthly savings**: Estimated 50-75% on input tokens

2. **Upstash Redis Caching** (Session Storage)
   - Stores conversation history and context (separate from Anthropic)
   - Used by production api/server.js for session management
   - Configured via UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL and UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
   - **Purpose**: Maintain conversation state across requests
   - **Does NOT** reduce Anthropic API costs (different system)

**Both systems are complementary:**
- Redis stores WHO said WHAT (conversation history)
- Anthropic caches HOW to respond (system prompt/instructions)

### API Key Usage
- Same `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` used for:
  1. Production API (api/server.js)
  2. Agent SDK testing (test-grant-card-direct.js)
- Loaded from `.env` file (gitignored)
- No separate keys needed for testing

---

## ✅ Ready for Testing

Everything is prepared! Just need to:
1. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Run `node test-grant-card-direct.js`
3. Review output and verify all validation checks pass
