# Grant Card Conciseness Fix - Documentation

## Problem

**Critical Usability Issue:** The Grant Card agent was producing "walls of text instead of scannable highlights" across ALL fields.

### Specific Issues

1. **Excessive verbosity:** Grant cards were 2000+ words instead of target 800-1200 words
2. **Poor scannability:** Dense paragraphs instead of bullet points, making 60-90 second scanning impossible
3. **Comprehensive documentation approach:** System was trying to document EVERYTHING instead of extracting strategic highlights
4. **No length enforcement:** Prompts lacked explicit word count limits and scannability constraints
5. **Field-specific problems:** Every field (Program Details, Eligibility, Activities, Expenses, Requirements, etc.) was dumping all available information

### Impact

- Users unable to quickly scan grant cards to make go/no-go decisions
- Information overload defeating the purpose of grant cards as decision-making tools
- Poor user experience - cards were comprehensive but unusable

## Root Cause

The prompt system lacked:
- **Explicit word count limits per field**
- **Universal scannability constraints**
- **Length enforcement mechanisms**
- **Pre-output quality checks**
- **Clear design philosophy** about grant cards being decision-making tools, not documentation

## Solution

Implemented multi-layered conciseness enforcement through 5 new prompt system components:

### 1. Universal Output Philosophy (`OUTPUT_PHILOSOPHY`)

**Location:** Added after `GRANT_TYPE_CLASSIFICATION` constant in both files

**Purpose:** Establishes fundamental principle that Grant Cards are DECISION-MAKING TOOLS, not comprehensive documentation

**Key Constraints:**
- Total output: 800-1200 words maximum (not 2000+)
- Individual fields: 50-200 words depending on complexity
- Sentences: Maximum 20-25 words, clear and direct
- Paragraphs: Maximum 2-3 sentences each
- Format: Bullet points for lists, NOT dense paragraphs
- Content: Most important details only - prioritize must-know > nice-to-know > can-look-up-later

**Scannability Test:**
```xml
After writing each field, ask: "Can a user understand the key point in 5-10 seconds?"
If no, the field is too long or poorly formatted. Revise before outputting.
```

### 2. Field-Specific Length Limits (`FIELD_LENGTH_LIMITS`)

**Applies to:** grant-criteria task only

**Field-by-field word limits:**

| Field | Max Words | Format | Focus |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Program Name | 1 line | Single line | Name only |
| Funder | 1 line | Single line | Organization name |
| Amount | 1-2 lines | Short text | Funding range |
| Deadline | 1-2 lines | Short text | Key dates |
| **Program Details** | **150 words** | 3-5 bullets OR 2-3 paragraphs | Application process, timelines, standout features |
| **Eligibility Criteria** | **100 words** | 5-8 bullet points | Must-have requirements only |
| **Eligible Activities** | **120 words** | Categorized bullets with 2-3 examples | Main activity categories |
| **Eligible Expenses** | **80 words** | 6-10 bullet points | Top expense categories only |
| **Ineligible Expenses** | **50 words** | 4-6 bullet points | Most common restrictions |
| **Application Requirements** | **100 words** | 6-8 bullet points | Core documentation requirements |
| **Evaluation Criteria** | **80 words** | Bullets with scoring weights | Top 4-6 criteria |
| **Other Important Details** | **100 words** | 3-5 bullet points | Critical program-specific details |

**Total possible:** ~900 words (within 800-1200 word target)

### 3. Length Enforcement Instructions (`LENGTH_ENFORCEMENT`)

**Embedded in Phase 3 of grant-criteria methodology**

**Active enforcement during extraction:**
- Count words in each field as you write
- If approaching limit, prioritize and cut less important details
- Use "e.g." to show examples without exhaustive lists
- Combine related items to save space
- Remember: Users can read the full source document if they need more detail

### 4. Pre-Output Checklist (`PRE_OUTPUT_CHECKLIST`)

**Embedded in Phase 4 of grant-criteria methodology**

**Quality verification before output:**
- □ Total output is 800-1200 words (not 2000+)
- □ Each field stays within its word limit
- □ Information is in bullets or short paragraphs
- □ No walls of text longer than 3 sentences
- □ Most important details are included
- □ Less critical details are omitted
- □ User can scan the entire card in 60-90 seconds

### 5. Enhanced Output Format Rules

**Added critical rules to output_format section:**

```xml
<critical_rule>EVERY field must be scannable in under 10 seconds</critical_rule>
<critical_rule>If any field exceeds its word limit, revise and shorten before outputting</critical_rule>
<critical_rule>Quality = strategic extraction, not comprehensive documentation</critical_rule>
```

**What to exclude:**
- Exhaustive lists of every possible item
- Repetitive information already stated in another field
- Generic boilerplate (unless critical to understanding)
- Minor procedural details
- Full paragraphs copied from source document

## Testing Strategy

### Test Documents

Use existing test documents from `/tests/` directory:

- Type: Digital Transformation & Export Readiness Program
- Funding: $25K - $250K
- Perfect for: Testing all fields, verifying word limits, checking scannability

**2. Minimal Grant (Edge case):**
- File: `tests/minimal-grant-for-testing.md`
- Type: Clean Energy Innovation Fund
- Funding: $50K - $500K
- Perfect for: Testing conciseness with sparse information

### Test Checklist

When testing the grant-criteria task:

**1. Word Count Verification:**
- [ ] Total output is 800-1200 words
- [ ] Program Details ≤ 150 words
- [ ] Eligibility Criteria ≤ 100 words
- [ ] Eligible Activities ≤ 120 words
- [ ] Eligible Expenses ≤ 80 words
- [ ] Ineligible Expenses ≤ 50 words
- [ ] Application Requirements ≤ 100 words
- [ ] Evaluation Criteria ≤ 80 words
- [ ] Other Important Details ≤ 100 words

**2. Format Compliance:**
- [ ] Lists are in bullet points (NOT paragraphs)
- [ ] Paragraphs are maximum 2-3 sentences
- [ ] No walls of text longer than 3 sentences
- [ ] White space between sections
- [ ] Field-specific format rules followed (see FIELD_LENGTH_LIMITS)

**3. Scannability Test:**
- [ ] Can understand each field's key point in 5-10 seconds
- [ ] Can scan entire card in 60-90 seconds
- [ ] Most important details are prominently featured
- [ ] No exhaustive lists or redundant information

**4. Content Quality:**

- [ ] Must-know information prioritized over nice-to-know
- [ ] Uses "e.g." for examples without exhaustive lists
- [ ] No repetition across fields

### Manual Testing Steps

```bash
# 1. Start development server
npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to Grant Cards agent
open http://localhost:3000/grant-cards

# 3. Paste comprehensive grant document content
# Copy from: tests/sample-grant-for-frontend-testing.md

# 4. Run grant-criteria task

# 5. Verify output:
#    a. Copy output to word counter tool
#    b. Check total word count (should be 800-1200)
#    c. Check each field against limits
#    d. Time yourself scanning the output (should be 60-90 sec)
#    e. Verify format (bullets, short paragraphs)

# 6. Repeat with minimal grant document
# Copy from: tests/minimal-grant-for-testing.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### If output still exceeds word limits:

**Check 1: Are the constants included?**
```bash
grep "OUTPUT_PHILOSOPHY\|FIELD_LENGTH_LIMITS" api/server.js
# Should return multiple matches
```

**Check 2: Is buildGrantCardSystemPrompt updated?**
```bash
grep -A 5 "const systemPrompt" api/server.js | grep OUTPUT_PHILOSOPHY
# Should show OUTPUT_PHILOSOPHY in system prompt
```

**Check 3: Clear any caches**
- Restart development server
- Clear browser cache
- Start new conversation

### If format is still dense paragraphs:

**Check:** Are the enhanced output_format rules present?
```bash
grep "critical_rule" api/server.js
# Should return 3 critical rules
```

### If fields still too verbose:

**Check:** Are FIELD_LENGTH_LIMITS embedded in Phase 3?
```bash
grep -A 3 "Phase 3.*Structured Extraction" api/server.js
# Should show "WITH STRICT LENGTH CONSTRAINTS" in description
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Specificity drives performance:** "150 words maximum" outperforms "be concise"
2. **Multiple enforcement layers:** Philosophy + limits + enforcement + checklist = compliance
3. **Format matters as much as content:** Bullets >> paragraphs for scannability
4. **Design principle crucial:** "Decision-making tool" vs. "comprehensive documentation" fundamentally changes output
5. **Pre-output checks work:** Checklist ensures agent self-corrects before presenting output
