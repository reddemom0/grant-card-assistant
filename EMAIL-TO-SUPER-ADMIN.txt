Subject: Quick Request - HubSpot Private App Setup (5 minutes)

Hi [Super Admin Name],

I'm working on enhancing our Granted AI Hub (the grant writing assistant) to pull client information from HubSpot. This will help it provide more personalized and accurate grant proposals.

I need your help creating a "private app" in HubSpot - it's basically a secure, read-only connection that lets our AI assistant look up contacts, companies, and deals when needed.

**What it does:**
- Gives our AI assistant VIEW-ONLY access to HubSpot contact/company/deal data
- Similar to giving someone a "read-only" user account, but for our software

**What it CANNOT do:**
- Change or delete anything
- Send emails
- Access settings or billing

**Time needed:** About 5 minutes

**Steps:**
1. Go to HubSpot → Settings (⚙️) → Integrations → Private Apps
   (Or: Development → Legacy apps)
2. Click "Create private app"
3. Name: "Granted AI Hub - Read Access"
4. Description: "Read-only access for AI agents to query CRM data"
5. Go to "Scopes" tab and select these READ permissions:
   - crm.objects.contacts.read
   - crm.objects.companies.read
   - crm.objects.deals.read
   - crm.lists.read
6. Click "Create app"
7. Copy the access token and send it to me securely

**Security:**
- This is read-only access - it can't modify anything
- You can delete the app anytime to instantly revoke access
- The token is stored securely in our encrypted environment variables

I've attached a detailed guide (HUBSPOT-PRIVATE-APP-REQUEST.md) with screenshots and step-by-step instructions if you need more details.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
