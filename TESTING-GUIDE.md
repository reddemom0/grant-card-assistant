**Steps:**
1. While logged in, click your profile dropdown
2. Click "Logout"
3. Try to visit agent pages directly:
   - Type in URL: `/grant-cards`
   - Type in URL: `/dashboard`
   - Type in URL: `/etg-writer`

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- Logout redirects to `/` (landing page)
- Trying to access `/grant-cards` ‚Üí redirects to `/`
- Trying to access `/dashboard` ‚Üí redirects to `/`
- Trying to access `/etg-writer` ‚Üí redirects to `/`

**‚ùå If it fails:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `granted_session` cookie was deleted
- Check DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies (should be empty)

---

### Test 4: User Profile Display

**What you're testing:** User info displays correctly on all pages

**Steps:**
1. Log in (Test 1)
2. Visit each agent page:
   - `/grant-cards`
   - `/etg-writer`
   - `/bcafe-writer`
   - `/canexport-claims`
3. On each page, check the top-right user profile area

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- Your Google profile picture displays (circular avatar)
- Your name displays next to avatar
- Clicking avatar shows dropdown with:
  - Your name/email
  - "Dashboard" link
  - "Logout" button
- Dropdown works on all pages

**‚ùå If it fails:**
- Open console, check for JWT decode errors
- Verify JWT token contains: `userId`, `email`, `name`, `picture`
- Check network tab for `/api/auth-callback` response

---

### Test 5: Conversation Creation & Persistence

**What you're testing:** User-scoped conversation storage

**Steps:**
1. Log in as User A (your Google account)
2. Go to `/grant-cards`
3. Send a message: "What is the ETG grant?"
4. Wait for response
5. Check conversation sidebar (left side)

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- Message sends successfully
- Response appears (Claude AI reply)
- Conversation appears in left sidebar
- Conversation title shows first few words of your message
- Message count shows "2" (your message + AI response)

**‚ùå If it fails:**
- Check console for API errors
- Check Network tab ‚Üí `/api/process-grant/stream`
- Verify `granted_session` cookie is sent with request
- Check Vercel function logs for errors

---

### Test 6: Conversation History Loading

**What you're testing:** Sidebar loads user's conversations

**Steps:**
1. Create 3-4 conversations in Grant Cards agent (different messages)
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Look at the left sidebar

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- All your conversations appear in sidebar
- Sorted by most recent first
- Each shows title and message count
- Clicking a conversation loads it
- Currently active conversation is highlighted

**‚ùå If it fails:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Network tab ‚Üí `/api/conversations` request
- Verify response includes all conversations
- Check PostgreSQL database for conversations table

---

### Test 7: Multi-User Isolation ‚≠ê CRITICAL

**What you're testing:** Users can't see each other's conversations

**Steps:**
1. **Browser 1 (Chrome):** Log in with your Google account (User A)
2. Create a conversation: "User A's private conversation"
3. Note the conversation appears in your sidebar
4. **Browser 2 (Firefox or Incognito):** Log in with DIFFERENT Google account (User B)
5. Check the sidebar in Browser 2

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- User B's sidebar is EMPTY (no conversations yet)
- User B does NOT see User A's conversation
- User B creates their own conversation: "User B's conversation"
- User A's sidebar (Browser 1) does NOT show User B's conversation
- Each user has completely separate conversation history

**‚ùå If it fails - CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE:**
- Check `/api/conversations` SQL query includes `WHERE user_id = $1`
- Verify JWT `userId` is being extracted correctly
- Check PostgreSQL: `SELECT * FROM conversations` should show different `user_id` values
- This is a security bug - conversations are leaking between users!

---

### Test 8: Conversation Switching

**What you're testing:** Clicking sidebar conversations loads them

**Steps:**
1. Create 3 conversations with different messages:
   - "What is ETG?"
   - "Tell me about BCAFE"
   - "How does CanExport work?"
2. Click on second conversation in sidebar
3. Click on third conversation
4. Click on first conversation

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- Each click loads the correct conversation
- Messages display in correct order
- Current conversation is highlighted in sidebar
- Chat input remains at bottom
- No duplicate messages

**‚ùå If it fails:**
- Check `/api/conversation/{id}` endpoint
- Verify it returns correct messages for conversation ID
- Check that `user_id` is being validated in query

---

### Test 9: Conversation Deletion

**What you're testing:** Delete button removes conversations

**Steps:**
1. Create a test conversation
2. Hover over the conversation in sidebar
3. Click the delete/trash icon (üóëÔ∏è)
4. Confirm deletion (if prompted)

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- Conversation disappears from sidebar immediately
- If conversation was active, chat area clears
- Conversation is gone after page refresh
- Other conversations remain untouched

**‚ùå If it fails:**
- Check `/api/conversation/{id}` DELETE request
- Verify SQL: `DELETE FROM conversations WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2`
- Check that foreign key cascade deletes messages too

---

### Test 10: Logout & Re-login

**What you're testing:** Complete auth lifecycle

**Steps:**
1. Log in, create a conversation
2. Logout (profile dropdown ‚Üí Logout)
3. Verify you're on landing page
4. Log in again with SAME Google account
5. Check conversation sidebar

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- After logout, redirected to `/`
- Cannot access `/grant-cards` (redirects to `/`)
- After re-login, redirected to `/dashboard`
- Conversation sidebar shows previous conversations
- Your data persists across sessions

**‚ùå If it fails:**
- Check cookie deletion on logout
- Verify new JWT token is created on re-login
- Check PostgreSQL conversations are still there

---

### Test 11: Agent Page Access Control

**What you're testing:** All 4 agent pages require authentication

**Steps:**
1. Logout completely
2. Try to access each agent page directly (type URL):
   - `/grant-cards`
   - `/etg-writer`
   - `/bcafe-writer`
   - `/canexport-claims`

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- All 4 pages redirect to `/` (login)
- No agent page content is visible
- "Sign in with Google" button appears
- After login, you CAN access all pages

---

### Test 12: Dashboard Navigation

**What you're testing:** Dashboard links work correctly

**Steps:**
1. Log in, go to `/dashboard`
2. Click each agent card:
   - Grant Card Assistant
   - CanExport Claims Assistant
   - ETG Business Case Specialist
   - BC Agriculture Export Specialist

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- Each card navigates to correct agent page
- Agent page loads with user profile visible
- "Coming Soon" agents show alert, don't navigate

---

### Test 13: Cross-Browser Session Isolation

**What you're testing:** Sessions are separate per browser

**Steps:**
1. **Chrome:** Log in as User A, create conversation "Chrome A"
2. **Firefox:** Log in as SAME User A
3. Check sidebar in Firefox

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- Firefox sidebar shows "Chrome A" conversation (same user)
- Creating conversation in Firefox appears in Chrome after refresh
- Same user's data syncs across browsers (because same user_id)

---

### Test 14: JWT Token Expiration (Long-term)

**What you're testing:** 7-day token expiration works

**Steps:**
1. Log in
2. Note the time
3. **Wait 7 days** (or manually expire cookie in DevTools)
4. Try to access `/grant-cards`

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- After 7 days, redirected to login
- Must log in again to access agents

**üîß To test now:**
- DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies
- Edit `granted_session` cookie
- Change Max-Age to 1 second
- Wait 2 seconds
- Try to access `/grant-cards` ‚Üí should redirect to `/`

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: OAuth Redirect Loop
**Symptom:** Keeps redirecting between `/` and `/dashboard`

**Cause:** Cookie not being set or wrong cookie name

**Fix:**
- Check DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies
- Verify `granted_session` cookie exists
- Check cookie domain matches your site
- Verify Secure flag is set (requires HTTPS)

### Issue 2: "Unauthorized" Error
**Symptom:** All API requests return 401

**Cause:** JWT token not being sent or invalid

**Fix:**
- Check Network tab, verify `Cookie: granted_session=...` header
- Verify JWT_SECRET environment variable is set in Vercel
- Check backend logs for JWT verification errors

### Issue 3: Can See Other User's Conversations
**Symptom:** User B sees User A's conversations

**Cause:** CRITICAL - Missing user_id in SQL queries

**Fix:**
- Check API code: `/api/conversations` should have `WHERE user_id = $1`
- Verify `getUserIdFromJWT()` is being called
- This is a security bug - must be fixed immediately!

### Issue 4: Profile Picture Not Showing
**Symptom:** Avatar is blank circle

**Cause:** JWT doesn't contain `picture` field

**Fix:**
- Check JWT payload in console: `getUserInfo()`
- Verify Google OAuth scopes include `profile`
- Check auth-callback.js includes `picture` in JWT

### Issue 5: Conversation Sidebar Empty
**Symptom:** Created conversations don't appear in sidebar

**Cause:** Not saving to PostgreSQL or Redis issue

**Fix:**
- Check Network tab ‚Üí `/api/process-grant/stream` response
- Check Vercel logs for database errors
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set
- Check PostgreSQL connection

## üîç Debugging Tools

### Browser Console
```javascript
// Check if authenticated
document.cookie.includes('granted_session')

// Decode JWT token
function getUserInfo() {
  const cookies = document.cookie.split(';');
  const authCookie = cookies.find(c => c.trim().startsWith('granted_session='));
  if (!authCookie) return null;
  const token = authCookie.split('=')[1];
  const payload = token.split('.')[1];
  return JSON.parse(atob(payload));
}
getUserInfo()
```

### Network Tab
- Watch for `/api/auth-google` ‚Üí should redirect to Google
- Watch for `/api/auth-callback` ‚Üí should set cookie
- Watch for `/api/conversations` ‚Üí should return user's conversations
- Watch for `/api/process-grant/stream` ‚Üí should stream AI responses

### Vercel Logs
```bash
# In terminal
vercel logs grant-card-assistant --follow

# Or in Vercel dashboard:
# Deployment ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí View Logs
```

### PostgreSQL Check
```sql
-- Check users table
SELECT id, email, name FROM users;

-- Check conversations by user
SELECT c.id, c.user_id, c.title, u.email
FROM conversations c
JOIN users u ON c.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC;

-- Check messages count
SELECT c.id, c.title, COUNT(m.id) as message_count
FROM conversations c
LEFT JOIN messages m ON m.conversation_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.id;
```
