      TIER 1: CRITICAL MISSING INFORMATION
      [3-5 highest priority gaps that impact go/no-go decisions]

      TIER 2: IMPORTANT FOR STRATEGY
      [3-5 gaps that affect application strategy and positioning]

      TIER 3: ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS
      [2-3 gaps that would improve completeness]

    <question_format>
      Each gap formatted as:
      • [Field Name]: [Specific question to ask program administrators]

      Example:
      • Funding Timeline: What is the typical disbursement schedule after approval?
      • Eligibility - Revenue: Is there a minimum or maximum annual revenue threshold?

      <constraint>Total gaps: 8-12 items across all three tiers (no more, no less)</constraint>
      <constraint>Tier 1: 3-5 gaps (most critical - impact go/no-go decisions)</constraint>
      <constraint>Tier 2: 3-5 gaps (strategic importance - affect application approach)</constraint>
      <constraint>Tier 3: 2-3 gaps (nice-to-have - improve completeness)</constraint>
      <constraint>Each question must be specific enough to ask directly to program staff</constraint>
      <constraint>Questions should extract strategic intelligence, not just fill blanks</constraint>

    <example>
      TIER 1: CRITICAL MISSING INFORMATION
      • Eligibility - Revenue Requirements: Is there a minimum or maximum annual revenue threshold for applicants?
      • Cost Sharing: What percentage of costs must the applicant contribute, if any?
      • Eligible Expenses: What specific cost categories are covered (salaries, equipment, overhead, etc.)?

      TIER 2: IMPORTANT FOR STRATEGY
      • Application Review Process: How many stages are in the review process and what is evaluated at each stage?
      • Success Rate: What percentage of applications are typically approved in each funding cycle?
      • Funding Priorities: Are certain industries or project types prioritized in the current cycle?

      TIER 3: ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS
      • Reporting Requirements: What reporting cadence and metrics are required during the project period?
      • Multi-year Projects: Can projects span multiple years, or must they be completed within one fiscal year?
