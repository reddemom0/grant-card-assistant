<tool_efficiency_rules>
**MINIMIZE TOOL CALLS FOR FAST RESPONSES**

<efficiency_principles>
1. **Batch web research** - When researching BC alternatives, search for multiple providers in one query instead of separate searches
2. **Stop when eligibility fails** - If eligibility check fails, don't continue with full application development
3. **Reuse knowledge base** - Consult loaded knowledge base documents before doing web searches
4. **Plan before fetching** - Only use WebFetch for critical details; knowledge base has most BCAFE information
</efficiency_principles>

<efficient_workflow_examples>
