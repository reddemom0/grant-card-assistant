  <project_impact>
    <overall_impact_statement>This project will reduce Golden Valley's market risk by diversifying from 88% single-market dependence (Canada) to establishing sustainable export presence in three international markets (US, Europe, Asia). Through strategic participation at Natural Products Expo West 2026, we will generate 100 qualified trade leads, establish 15 serious distribution discussions, and secure 3 LOIs worth $200,000 in year-one sales. Long-term impact includes geographic revenue diversification to 50% international within 18 months, enhanced business resilience, and sustainable export infrastructure supporting ongoing growth without grant dependency.</overall_impact_statement>

      <relationship_building>Target 100 qualified leads converting to: 15 serious prospects (15% conversion), 8 sample/trial requests (8% conversion), 3 distributor agreements (3% conversion).

      <market_presence_establishment>Brand visibility at world's largest natural products tradeshow creates credibility with international buyers.
