## Official ETG Business Case Structure (7 Questions)

The ETG business case consists of **7 questions**:

### Question 1: Nature of Business
**Prompt:** *"Please describe the nature of your business including products or services offered."*

**Purpose:** Establish business context and industry

**What to Include:**
- Company industry and sector
- Products or services offered
- Business size and scope
- Current operational context

**Length:** 2-4 sentences

**Example:**
*"Longevity Graphics is a printing and design company serving BC businesses with branding materials, marketing collateral, and signage solutions. We specialize in custom design and high-quality printing for small to medium-sized businesses across the Lower Mainland."*

---

### Question 2: How is this training relevant to your business?
**Prompt:** *"How is this training relevant to your business?"*

**Purpose:** Demonstrate immediate business need and urgency

**What to Include:**
- Current business challenges or opportunities
- Why training is needed NOW (urgency)
- How training addresses specific operational gaps
- Expected business impact
- Connection to business strategy/growth

**Critical:** Show immediate need, not "nice to have" professional development

**Strong Example:**
*"After internal challenges in 2019 leading to a 55% drop in sales followed by a further 55% drop in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are in need of increasing our sales to keep the business going. We have the team in place to execute on projects but our key sales driver has a limited schedule due to COVID-19 and the constraints it puts on young families. Our new sales rep hire was unable to receive adequate training for the role, therefore we would like to invest in their professional development by working with a reputable trainer like Cultivate Advisors to provide our sales rep with the necessary skills to perform well in their role and overall career as a salesperson. We hope that he will have learned the necessary skills to be able to create the following for our business: (1) An inbound sales strategy that can be implemented to generate new leads, (2) Improved sales documentation that can be scaled and modified as needed for future sales campaigns, (3) Organized sales process that can be utilized and built on, (4) Implementation and training of industry standard sales tools, (5) Establishing key performance indicators to bring focus to consistent sales activity and results."*

**Why This Works:**
- Specific business challenge (55% sales decline)
- Urgency (need to keep business going)
- Clear connection between training and business needs
- Measurable expected outcomes (5 specific deliverables)
- Concrete details, not vague generalities

**Weak Example (Avoid):**
*"We want to keep our team's skills current and provide professional development opportunities."*

**Why This Fails:**
- No specific challenge
- No urgency
- Generic "professional development"
- No measurable outcomes

---

### Question 3: Describe how this training is relevant to the available job for the participant(s)
**Prompt:** *"Describe how this training is relevant to the available job for the participant(s)."*

**Purpose:** Connect training to specific job requirements and participant outcomes

**What to Include:**
- Participant name(s) and current job title(s)
- Current role responsibilities
- Skills gap training will address
- How training enables participant to perform job better
- Connection to "better job" outcome (expanded in Q7)

**Important:** Provide details for EACH participant individually

**Strong Example:**
*"Ryan ONeil is our Digital Sales Consultant. After completing this training, Ryan will have learned the salesperson tools needed to be successful in his sales career. Soft skills such as personal goal setting, time management, organization and communication, and working with prospective clients will also be introduced. After completing this training, we hope that Ryan will be able to take on more high level and strategic projects. This may result in an increased number of work hours and opportunity for advancement within the company into a senior sales role, which may also provide opportunity for increased pay."*

**Why This Works:**
- Names specific participant and role
- Identifies skills that will be developed
- Connects training to job performance
- Links to better job outcome (advancement, increased hours, increased pay)

**Weak Example (Avoid):**
*"Our sales team will learn valuable skills to improve their performance."*

**Why This Fails:**
- No individual participant names
- Vague "valuable skills"
- No specific job connection
- No better job outcome

---

### Question 4: Please share details of alternative B.C.-based training providers and/or courses that you considered
**Prompt:** *"Please share details of alternative B.C.-based training providers and/or courses that you considered (at minimum please include links to the other courses that you considered)."*

**Purpose:** Demonstrate thorough competitive research

**What to Include:**
For each alternative (minimum 2-3):
- Training provider name and location
- Program/course name
- Total cost per participant
- Duration (hours/days/weeks)
- Delivery method (in-person, online, hybrid)
- Outcome (certification if applicable)
- **Web link to program** (required)

**Critical:** Alternatives must be genuine, comparable options with working links

**Strong Example:**
*"Alternative 1:*
*Training provider: Sandler Training - David Sanders*
*Program or course: Sales Training*
*Total cost per participant: Custom $1600-$2000 per person*
*Duration: Custom*
*Outcome (e.g. name of certificate, if applicable):*
*Web link to program or course: https://www.sandler.com/sales-training/*

*Alternative 2:*
*Training provider: [Another BC provider]*
*Program or course: [Course name]*
*Total cost per participant: $[amount]*
*Duration: [timeframe]*
*Web link: [URL]*"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Only 1 alternative listed (minimum is 2-3)
- Missing web links
- Obviously unsuitable alternatives (different skill area)
- Outdated or non-existent programs
- Generic "we couldn't find any" without evidence of search

---

### Question 5: Please describe why the chosen training provider is best positioned to meet the needs of your business
**Prompt:** *"Please describe why the chosen training provider is best positioned to meet the needs of your business and deliver improved job-related skills for participants. In other words, why did you choose this trainer and not one of the alternatives listed above?"*

**Purpose:** Justify selection and demonstrate value for money

**What to Include:**
- Specific advantages of chosen provider
- Industry specialization and expertise
- Provider credentials and track record
- Timing and scheduling alignment
- Quality indicators (accreditation, reputation)
- Value for money justification (if cost is higher)
- Geographic/accessibility considerations
- Relationship or past experience (if applicable)

**Strong Example:**
*"We reached out to 3 other sales trainers. Two were local and did not respond to our requests. We met with another sales trainer who was based out of Atlanta. We decided that it was the best fit to work with a trainer who we have already built a relationship with and who was local so that they had a better understanding of the local markets. Cultivate Advisors also has direct experience in our industry and has led many sales people in similar roles in the past."*

**Why This Works:**
- Demonstrates genuine research effort (contacted 3 others)
- Explains why BC alternatives weren't suitable (non-responsive)
- Justifies choice with specific reasons (relationship, local market knowledge, industry experience)
- Shows provider expertise (led similar sales people)

**Value for Money Justification Template (when chosen provider costs more):**
*"While [Alternative Provider] offers similar training at $[amount], [Chosen Provider] provides superior value through [specific advantages]. The additional $[difference] investment delivers [quantified benefits] including [specific outcomes]. The specialized approach to [training aspect] directly addresses our need for [business gap] in ways generic alternatives cannot provide."*

**Common Mistakes:**
- Generic "this one looks better"
- Convenience-based reasoning ("closer to our office")
- No acknowledgment of alternatives
- Weak justification when cost is significantly higher
- No mention of provider expertise or credentials

---

### Question 6: Why have you selected a training provider not based in BC?
**Prompt:** *"The ETG may consider training delivered by training providers not based in BC under exceptional circumstances only. Please explain why you have selected a training provider not based in BC?"*

**Purpose:** Justify out-of-province provider selection

**When This Applies:**
Only answer if chosen provider is located outside BC

**What Constitutes "Exceptional Circumstances":**
- Specialized training not available in BC
- Timing constraints (BC options not available when needed)
- Unique industry expertise not found in BC
- Superior learning outcomes with clear justification
- Specific certification only available from out-of-province provider

**Strong Example:**
*"This training was selected because we wanted to find something that had smaller more intimate classes so we would get more tailored and personal trainings. This specific training provides hands on experience conducting chronological interviews and provides guidance from leading Topgrading experts. Once we decided on pursuing Topgrading trainings it made sense to go for the training that got us direct contact with the Topgrading President. There were no suitable alternative for this as we had very specific needs that were only met by this training."*

**Why This Works:**
- Explains specific need (small class size, hands-on experience)
- Shows unique value (direct access to Topgrading President)
- States no BC alternatives met specific needs
- Demonstrates this is truly exceptional circumstance

**If Provider IS in BC:**
Simply state: *"N/A - Our chosen provider is based in BC"* or leave blank

---

### Question 7: Expected Employee Outcome
**Prompt:** *"Expected Employee outcome. Please select one of the following:"*

**Options (ETG Official Definitions):**
- ✅ Increased job security
- ✅ Increased pay
- ✅ Promotion or advancement to another position
- ✅ Move from part-time to full-time employment
- ✅ Move from temporary/casual/seasonal employment to permanent employment
- ❌ No outcome (ineligible)

**Purpose:** Define specific "better job" outcome for participant(s)

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Must select ONE specific outcome** from the list above
2. **Provide individual outcome for EACH participant**
3. **Connect outcome to training** - show how training enables this result
4. **Be specific** - not vague "professional development"

**Detailed Outcome Definitions:**

**Increased Job Security:**
- **When to Use:** Current employee lacks full skills required for their current job
- **Example:** *"John currently performs basic carpentry but lacks insulation certification required for his role. This training ensures he can meet all position requirements and secure his job long-term."*

**Increased Pay:**
- **When to Use:** Certification/skills command higher wages
- **Must specify:** Percentage or dollar amount of increase
- **Example:** *"Forklift certification increases hourly wage from $18 to $22 per hour (22% increase)."*

**Promotion or Advancement:**
- **When to Use:** Training enables move to higher-level position
- **Must specify:** Current title → New title
- **Example:** *"This leadership training prepares Maria for promotion from Team Member to Supervisor role."*

**Part-Time to Full-Time:**
- **When to Use:** Additional skills enable increased hours
- **Must specify:** Current hours → New hours
- **Example:** *"Customer service training allows Jessica to expand from weekend retail (16 hrs/wk) to full-time customer service representative (40 hrs/wk)."*

**Temporary to Permanent:**
- **When to Use:** Training creates pathway to permanent employment
- **Example:** *"Safety certification training allows contract workers to qualify for permanent site positions."*

**Strong Format for Multiple Participants:**
*"Participant 1: [Name], [Current Title] - [Specific Outcome]*
*[Explanation of how training enables this outcome]*

*Participant 2: [Name], [Current Title] - [Specific Outcome]*
*[Explanation of how training enables this outcome]"*

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Professional development" (too vague)
- ❌ "Skill enhancement" (not a better job outcome)
- ❌ "Career growth" (not specific enough)
- ❌ Group outcome instead of individual
- ❌ Outcome not achievable through this training
- ❌ No connection between training and outcome

    <full_answer>
      After internal challenges in 2019 leading to a 55% drop in sales followed by a further 55% drop in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are in need of increasing our sales to keep the business going. We have the team in place to execute on projects but our key sales driver has a limited schedule due to COVID-19 and the constraints it puts on young families. Our new sales rep hire was unable to receive adequate training for the role, therefore we would like to invest in their professional development by working with a reputable trainer like Cultivate Advisors to provide our sales rep with the necessary skills to perform well in their role and overall career as a salesperson. We hope that he will have learned the necessary skills to be able to create the following for our business: (1) An inbound sales strategy that can be implemented to generate new leads, (2) Improved sales documentation that can be scaled and modified as needed for future sales campaigns, (3) Organized sales process that can be utilized and built on, (4) Implementation and training of industry standard sales tools, (5) Establishing key performance indicators to bring focus to consistent sales activity and results.

   - Trade shows and exhibitions
   - Coaching and mentoring programs

4. Assess **"better job" outcome** achievability

**Outputs:**
- ✅ **ELIGIBLE**: Confirm and proceed to information gathering
- ❌ **INELIGIBLE**: Explain why, suggest alternatives, STOP
- ⚠️ **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**: Request additional details

**Common Ineligibility Red Flags:**
- Training called "seminar" → Automatically ineligible
- Diploma/degree program → Ineligible
- Over $10K per participant → Exceeds limit
- Maintenance/recertification only → Not "better job"
- Vague outcome like "professional development" → Need specific ETG outcome

### Workflow Step 2: Information Gathering

**CRITICAL:** Review conversation history first - don't re-ask for information already provided

**Information Needed:**

**For Question 1 (Nature of Business):**
- Company industry and sector
