## Implementation Summary

### 1. Memory Tool Handler (`api/memory-tool-handler.js`)

**Lines**: 388
**Purpose**: Execute all memory operations with security validation

**Commands Implemented**:
- ✅ `view` - Read memory file contents
- ✅ `create` - Create new memory files
- ✅ `str_replace` - Update existing memory (find/replace)
- ✅ `insert` - Insert content at specific line
- ✅ `delete` - Delete memory files
- ✅ `rename` - Rename or move memory files

**Security Features**:
- Path traversal protection (all operations restricted to `/memories`)
- Character validation (blocks `;` `&` `|` `` ` `` `$` `(` `)` `<` `>` `\`)
- Null byte detection
- File size limits (1MB max per file)
- Comprehensive error handling

### 2. API Server Integration (`api/server.js`)

5. **Updated streaming API** (lines 4083, 4092)
6. **Enhanced all 5 agent prompts** with memory instructions

**Beta Headers Added**:
```javascript
'anthropic-beta': 'files-api-2025-04-14,context-management-2025-06-27'
```

**Tools Array**:
```javascript

## Security Enhancements

### Path Validation Hardening

**Before**:
```javascript
// Only checked for /memories prefix and path traversal
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Check for invalid characters (command injection)
const invalidChars = /[;&|`$()<>\\]/;
if (invalidChars.test(requestedPath)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid characters in path');
}

// Check for null bytes
if (requestedPath.includes('\0')) {
  throw new Error('Null bytes not allowed in path');
}

// Path traversal protection
if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(MEMORY_BASE_DIR)) {
  throw new Error('Path traversal detected');
}
```

**Blocked Attack Patterns**:
- ✅ `; rm -rf /` (command injection with semicolon)
- ✅ `../../../etc/passwd` (directory traversal)
- ✅ `/etc/passwd` (absolute path outside memory)
- ✅ `file.xml\0malicious` (null byte injection)
- ✅ `../../outside.xml` (symbolic link traversal)

## Use Case Examples

### Use Case 1: Learning from Corrections

**Scenario**: User corrects eligibility interpretation

```
User: "Actually, coaching programs ARE eligible if they're structured
       training, not just mentoring"

Agent Action:
1. Uses memory tool (view) to check corrections.xml
2. If exists, uses str_replace to add correction
3. If new, uses create:

File: /memories/user_feedback/corrections.xml
<corrections>
  <correction date="2025-10-15" topic="ETG Eligibility">
    <original>Coaching programs are ineligible</original>
    <corrected>Coaching programs ARE eligible if structured training</corrected>
    <source>etg-writer-20251015</source>
  </correction>
</corrections>

Next Session:
Agent checks corrections.xml at start → automatically applies learned rule
```

**Test Result**: ✅ Validated in test suite (Persistence: Learning from corrections pattern)

### Use Case 2: Multi-Day Project Tracking

**Scenario**: User pauses grant application work

```
Day 1:
User provides info, agent drafts sections, user says "continue tomorrow"

Agent Action: Uses memory tool (create)
File: /memories/projects/active/acme-corp-canexport.xml
<project name="ACME Corp CanExport" date="2025-10-15">
  <status>In Progress</status>
  <completed>
    - Eligibility verified
    - Company info gathered
    - Grant Card created
  </completed>
  <next_steps>
    - Draft market analysis
    - Create readiness assessment
  </next_steps>
</project>

Day 2:
User: "Let's continue with the CanExport application"
Agent: (views project file) "Picking up where we left off. I'll now
       draft the market analysis section based on the company profile..."

Result: Zero context loss, seamless resumption
```

**Test Result**: ✅ Validated in test suite (Persistence: Multi-day project tracking pattern)

### Use Case 3: Approved Format Storage

**Scenario**: User approves specific grant card format

```
User: "This grant card format is perfect - use this structure for
       all future CanExport cards"

Agent Action: Uses memory tool (create)
File: /memories/user_feedback/approvals.xml
<approvals>
  <approval date="2025-10-15" type="Grant Card Format" program="CanExport SME">
    <approved_elements>
      - Eligibility: Bullet points with ✓/✗ symbols
      - Funding: Show calculation formula
      - Timeline: Both deadline AND project timeline
      - Requirements: Max 5 bullets, priority order
    </approved_elements>
    <user_preference>Concise, scannable, action-oriented</user_preference>
  </approval>
</approvals>

Future Sessions: All CanExport grant cards follow approved format
```

### Use Case 4: Building Institutional Knowledge

**Scenario**: Successful grant pattern completed

```
Agent completes successful grant application

Agent Action: Uses memory tool (create)
File: /memories/knowledge_base/grant_patterns/canexport-tech-export.xml
<pattern program="CanExport SME" industry="Technology" date="2025-10-15">
  <success_factors>
    - Digital service export (SaaS platform)
    - Market validation (pilot customers in target market)
    - Specific entry strategy (partnership with local distributor)
    - Realistic budget ($45K total, $22.5K requested)
  </success_factors>
  <effective_positioning>
    - "Market expansion" not "market research"
    - Export-readiness emphasized
    - Competitor analysis included
  </effective_positioning>
  <outcome>Approved (exceeded 36% benchmark)</outcome>
</pattern>

Future Tech Export Applications: Reference this successful pattern
```
